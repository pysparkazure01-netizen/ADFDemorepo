Parallel Execution with Thread Workers

Instead of processing one record → one API call → one log update in sequence, we now use a ThreadPoolExecutor with 10 worker threads.

This means 10 API calls run in parallel, reducing end-to-end runtime by ~90% compared to sequential execution.

Example: If 1,000 records take 1,000 seconds sequentially, they now complete in ~100 seconds.
